It helps extract meaningful information, reduce noise, and evem improve the performance and interpretability of machine learning algorithms.\n",

Conversely, changing the basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ leads to a matrix representation of $T$ that is similar to $A$ (section 3.4). This particularly applies to diagonalizable matrices because a matrix is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix.\n",
