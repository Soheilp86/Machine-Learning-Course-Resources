    "In this lab, you will work with a dataset that describes various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The objective is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the prices of each home based on a set of 79 explanatory variables. Your goal is to consider a wide range of factors that impact house prices, and it's worth noting that this dataset is used as part of an ongoing Kaggle competition.\n",

    "__Step 1 (Data Loading):__ Start by accessing the dataset on the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and carefully read the data description to familiarize yourself with its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 2 (Data Engineering):__ This step involves various data preprocessing tasks, including data cleaning, one-hot encoding, handling missing values (NaNs), and addressing any negative infinity (-inf) values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 3 (Dimension Reduction):__ Here, you will explore dimension reduction techniques with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) being one of the potential choices, to reduce the number of features while preserving as much information as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 4 (Model Selection):__ Use Linear Regression to model and predict the sales value!\n",
