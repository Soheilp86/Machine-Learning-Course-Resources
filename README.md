# Machine-Learning-Course-Resources
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and labs for a course on the Mathematical Foundation of Machine Learning (MFML). The MFML course explores the application of linear algebra in machine learning and covers topics in multivariable calculus, optimization, and probability. The course incorporates mini-projects as homework assignments that collectively serve as a step-by-step guide for students to complete their final projects independently. MFML is an ongoing course, with more materials to be added.

Topics include:

Linear Algebra:
- Matrix Decomposition (LU factorization, QR-factorization, Diagonalization)
- Least Square problem
- Singular Value Decomposition and its applications

Multivariable Calculus:
- Tensor Calculus
- Backpropagation and Automatic Differentiation

Foundational Models in ML:
- PCA
- Regression
- Neural Network
- SVD
